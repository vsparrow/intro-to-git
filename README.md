    Check the status of your repository
    Create a new directory named secret_stuff
    Create two files inside of secret_stuff named file1.yml and file2.js
    Create a .gitignore file so we can ignore the secret_stuff directory and all of its contents
    Add the secret_stuff folder to the .gitignore file 
    Check the status of your repository
    Add the .gitignore file to the staging area
    If your staging area looks like the image below then you have completed this exercise successfully. You may now commit your changes
